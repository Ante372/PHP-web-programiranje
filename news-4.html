               <h2>W3C and WHATWG come together for HTML and DOM specifications</h2>
               <p class="description">The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) will collaborate on developing a single version of the HTML and DOM specifications – in a move which may help bring the two factions closer together.</p>
               <p>W3C and WHATWG will work together on HTML and DOM, housed in and maintained by the WHATWG repositories, to produce a living standard</p>
               <p>W3C will facilitate community work directly in the WHATWG repositories, to include bridging communities, developing use cases, filing issues, writing tests, and mediating issue resolution</p>
               <p>W3C will stop independently publishing a designated list of specifications related to HTML and DOM, instead working to take WHATWG review drafts to W3C recommendations</p>
               <p>Writing in a blog post confirming the cessation of hostilities, W3C CEO Jeff Jaffe noted the move was a continuation of partnership mechanisms, first begun in December 2017.</p>
               <p>Since then, W3C membership [has] weighed in regularly including at two bi-annual meetings; there were several direct meetings between W3C management and the WHATWG Steering Group,” wrote Jaffe.</p>
               <p>W3C remains committed to ensuring that HTML development continues to take into account the needs of the global community.</p>
