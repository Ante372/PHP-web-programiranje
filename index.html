        <figcaption>Frederick Phillips "Fred" Brooks Jr.(<time datetime=1931-04-19>born 19 April 1931</time>)is an American computer architect, software engineer, and computer scientist, best known for managing the development of IBM's System/360 family of computers </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Born in Durham, North Carolina, he attended Duke University, graduating in 1953 with a Bachelor of Science degree in physics, and he received a Ph.D. in applied mathematics (computer science) from Harvard University in 1956, supervised by Howard Aiken.</p>
      <p>Brooks joined IBM in 1956, working in Poughkeepsie, New York, and Yorktown, New York. He worked on the architecture of the IBM 7030 Stretch, a $10 million scientific supercomputer of which nine were sold, and the IBM 7950 Harvest computer for the National Security Agency.</p>
      <p>In 1964, Brooks accepted an invitation to come to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and founded the University's computer science department.</p>
      <p>In 2004 in a talk at the Computer History Museum and also in a 2010 interview in Wired magazine, Brooks was asked "What do you consider your greatest technological achievement?" Brooks responded, "The most important single decision I ever made was to change the IBM 360 series from a 6-bit byte to an 8-bit byte, thereby enabling the use of lowercase letters.</p>
      <p>Brooks has received many awards, including the National Medal of Technology in 1985 and the Turing Award in 1999.</p>
