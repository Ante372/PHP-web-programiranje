               <h2>Apple is giving iOS apps which handle real cash in an HTML5 wrapper a bit longer to transition to native</h2>
               <p class="description">Apple is giving iOS developers whose apps use HTML5 containers and deal with real cash, six months longer to make them fully-native.</p>
               <p>HTML5 games distributed in apps may not provide access to real money gaming, lotteries, or charitable donations, and may not support digital commerce.</p>
               <p>This functionality is only appropriate for code that’s embedded in the binary and can be reviewed by Apple.</p>
               <p>Cupertino’s initial deadline for the change was September 3rd, 2019. Obviously, that data has now come and gone.</p>
               <p>Apple clearly felt it did not give enough time for the transition and perhaps many apps were facing being axed from the App Store, so it’s decided to extend the deadline a further six months.</p>
               <p>Gambling apps, in particular, have a tendency to use HTML5 wrappers.</p>
               <p>The use of web containers allows apps to be deployed on the App Store quicker and more cheaply than building native apps.</p>
